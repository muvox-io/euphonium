# IDF Component Manager

The IDF Component manager is a tool that downloads dependencies for any [ESP-IDF](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/sdks/esp-idf) CMake project. It makes sure that the right versions of all components required for a successful build of your project are in place. The download happens automatically during a run of CMake. It can source components either from [the component registry](https://components.espressif.com/) or from a git repository.

**A list of components can be found on https://components.espressif.com/**

## Installing the IDF Component Manager

IDF component manager can be used with ESP-IDF v4.1 and later.

Starting ESP-IDF v4.4 the [idf-component-manager](https://pypi.org/project/idf-component-manager/) package is installed by default and no extra action is necessary.

In ESP-IDF v4.1 — v4.3, you need to install the following Python package to use the component manager:

```bash
source $IDF_PATH/export.sh
pip install idf-component-manager --upgrade
```

## Disabling the Component Manager

The component manager can be explicitly disabled by setting `IDF_COMPONENT_MANAGER` environment variable to `0`.

## Using with a project

You can add `idf_component.yml` manifest files with the list of dependencies to any component in your project.

IDF Component Manager will download dependencies automatically during the project build process.

When CMake configures the project (e.g. `idf.py reconfigure`) component manager does a few things:

- Processes `idf_component.yml` manifests for every component in the project
- Creates a `dependencies.lock` file in the root of the project with a full list of dependencies
- Downloads all dependencies to the `managed_components` directory

The component manager won't try to regenerate `dependencies.lock` or download any components if manifests, lock file, and content of `managed_component` directory weren't modified since the last successful build.

## Defining dependencies in the manifest

All dependencies are defined in the manifest file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  # Required IDF version
  idf: ">=4.1"
  # For components maintained by Espressif only name can be used.
  # Same as `espressif/component`
  component:
    version: "~2.0.0"
  # Or in a shorter form
  component2: ">=1.0.0"
  # For 3rd party components :
  username/component:
    version: "~1.0.0"
    # For transient dependencies `public` flag can be set.
    public: true
  anotheruser/component: "<3.2.20"
  # For components hosted on non-default registry:
  company_user/component:
    version: "~1.0.0"
    service_url: "https://componentregistry.company.com"
  # For components in git repository:
  test_component:
    path: test_component
    git: ssh://git@gitlab.com/user/components.git
  # For test projects during component development
  # components can be used from a local directory
  # with relative or absolute path
  some_local_component:
    path: ../../projects/component
  # For optional dependencies
  optional_component:
    version: "~1.0.0"
    rules: # will add "optional_component" only when all if clauses are True
      - if: "idf_version >=3.3,<5.0" # supports all SimpleSpec grammars (https://python-semanticversion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html#semantic_version.SimpleSpec)
      - if: "target in [esp32, esp32c3]" # supports boolean operator ==, !=, in, not in.
  # For example of the component
  namespace/component_with_example:
    version: "~1.0.0" # if there is no `override_path` field, use component from registry
    override_path: "../../" # use component in a local directory, not from registry
```

## Environment variables in manifest

You can use environment variables in values in `idf_component.yml` manifests. `$VAR` or `${VAR}` is replaced with the value of the `VAR` environment variable. If the environment variable is not defined, the component manager will raise an error.

Variable name should be ASCII alphanumeric string (including underscores) and start with an underscore or ASCII letter. The first non-identifier character after the `$` terminates this placeholder specification. You can escape `$` with one more`$` character, i.e., `$$` is replaced with `$`.

One possible use-case is providing authentication to git repositories accessed through HTTPS:

```yaml
dependencies:
  my_component:
    git: https://git:${ACCESS_TOKEN}@git.my_git.com/my_component.git
```
