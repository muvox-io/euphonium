/**
 * This class implements a wrapper around an arbitrary bell::ByteStream,
 * providing a circular reading buffer with configurable thresholds.
 *
 * The BufferedStream runs a bell::Task when it's started, so the caller can
 * access the buffer's data asynchronously, whenever needed. The buffer is refilled
 * automatically from source stream.
 *
 * The class implements bell::ByteStream's methods, although for proper functioning,
 * the caller code should be modified to check isReady() and isNotReady() flags.
 *
 * If the actual reading code can't be modified, waitForReady allows to wait for buffer readiness
 * during reading. Keep in mind that using the semaphore is probably more resource effective.
 *
 * The source stream (passed to open() or returned by the reader) should implement the read()
 * method correctly, such as that 0 is returned if, and only if the stream ends.
